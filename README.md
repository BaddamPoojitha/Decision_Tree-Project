Project Title: Prediction of iris.csv dataset for decision tree algorithm using Supervised learning machine algorithm
# Problem Statement:
A American based botnical garden grow iris flower in there labs but using bio techology in a single tree different types of variety flower is grow.As a data science engineer find out how much accuracy is there all categories contains same species.
